Present your work in a professional, engaging, and appealing manner. Your website will be linked from the HCI+D course web page, and previous students have used their websites to talk about their project for their job search and interviews!

You must create and maintain a website documenting your project. Your site should tell the story of your project’s development in a clear and compelling manner. Do not assume any prior knowledge of your project – your website should be easily understood by someone who is completely unaffiliated with NTU. Ideally, this website will be a tool that you can use to communicate your design and prototyping skills to potential employers. Your website should be responsive, logically structured, and aesthetically appealing.

See the grading criteria (below) for a list of the elements that must be represented on your website. Below is a list of assignments that must be included on your site (including presentation slides and prototypes), the assignment numbers are for your reference and ​should not be on the site​​.
